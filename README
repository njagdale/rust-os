This is an exercise from the Intermezzos project http://intermezzos.github.io/
All credits to the code go to the authors of the Intermezzos project
referenced above. This work is merely a study and an implementation
of the project.

Purpose:
The project has been created in a cargo project and is designed to
launch a very simple kernel that prints "Hello Rust" in QEMU.

Pre-requsities:
- Ubunut 20.04 (If running on Virtual Box, ensure Nested Virtualization Support is enabled)
- Install Rust Language, see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install 
- Install QEMU on Ubuntu, see https://www.qemu.org/download/
- Setup development environment, see http://intermezzos.github.io/book/second-edition/hello-world/setup.html
- Setup project, see http://intermezzos.github.io/book/second-edition/hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html
- Notes: Dependencies seems to work only with specific nightly toolchains and components. In order to preserve this execute:
    $ rustup override set nightly-2020-05-15
    $ cargo install bootimage
    $ cargo install cargo-xbuild
    $ rustup component add rust-src --toolchain=nightly-2020-05-15
    $ rustup component add llvm-tools-preview

Run the project:
$ cargo r 

Expected Output:
QEMU launches with programmed text displayed.
